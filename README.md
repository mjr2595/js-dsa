# JavaScript DSA, Algos, and Interview Prep Stuff

This is a collection of JavaScript data structures, algorithms, and interview prep stuff. Basically a catchall repo for various courses and resources I've been using to learn JavaScript and prepare for technical interviews.

Courses and resources include:

- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
- [JavaScript Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/)
